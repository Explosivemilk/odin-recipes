This is a simple html project to practice what we have learned so far. Very very very basic information and the site doesn't look too good but it's functional and displays the information required which is all we need to do at the moment. 

The project itself wasn't hard at all, just tedious writing down all the instructions and ingredients though it's good practice to get a basic foundation on the barebones of a website. I think I'll have to improve on the committing portion of making a website as I don't know if I was doing it too often.
