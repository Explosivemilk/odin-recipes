    <h2>Delicious Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas</h2>
    <p>This is a simple and easy, albeit time-consuming, recipe to make some delicious chicken enchiladas. The process
        will take about an hour though 40 of those minutes are waiting for the oven to finish cooking your dish. Be
        aware the process will involve shredding hot chicken that could cause possible burns as well as frying tortillas
        that seem to have the life goal of falling apart before they can be set out of the pan.</p>
